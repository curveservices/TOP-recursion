## Overview

[Exercise recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) has been set as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Two assignments were set. First was to solve the fibonacci sequence using recursion and second to sort an unsorted array using recursive merge sort methodology.

## Assets

- 

## Obejective

1. Assignment 1 The [Fibonacci Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)
- Using iteration, write a function fibs() which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
- Write another function fibsRec() which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just a couple of lines
2. Assignment 2 Merge Sort
- Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology
